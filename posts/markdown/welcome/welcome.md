They say an image speaks a thousand words, so here is the product of my work. Over the past year I have been intermittently memorizing over a thousand kanji and a few thousands of Japanese vocabulary words. Although I often struggled to gauge my reading comprehension—some words I knew well, others I had never seen—out of frustration I spent an evening coding a Chrome extension that loads your Anki deck and immediately lets you visualize your progress in reading comprehension. In simple terms, words you know well are underlined in green, while those you know less well in red. Available now on my GitHub at this [link](https://github.com/ghovax/AnkiLevels). Free for anyone to use as they please under any permissive license that may apply. For the technical read see below.
