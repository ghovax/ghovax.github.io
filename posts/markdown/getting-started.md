# Getting Started with Static Sites

Static site generators are a great way to build fast, secure websites without the need for a backend database or server-side processing.

## Benefits

- Fast loading times
- Easy to host (GitHub Pages, Netlify, etc.)
- Version control with Git
- No security vulnerabilities from server-side code

## Markdown Support

You can use all standard Markdown features:

- **Bold text**
- *Italic text*
- `Code snippets`
- [Links](https://example.com)

```python
def hello():
    print("Hello, World!")
```
