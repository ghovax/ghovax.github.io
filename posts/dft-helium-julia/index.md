# Welcome to My Portfolio

Welcome to my professional portfolio! This is a space where I share my work, projects, and thoughts on technology and development.

## About This Blog

This blog is built with a custom markdown-based system that supports:

- **Mathematical expressions** using LaTeX notation
- **Interactive components** embedded directly in posts
- **Clean, formal typography** optimized for readability
- **Responsive design** that works on all devices

## Mathematical Examples

Here's an inline equation: $E = mc^2$, and here's a display equation:

$$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \sqrt{\pi}$$

The quadratic formula is given by:

$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$

## Interactive Components

Below is an example of an embedded interactive component. This demonstrates how I can insert visualizations and interactive elements directly into blog posts:

<div data-component="ExampleChart" data-props='{"title":"Sample Data Visualization"}'></div>

## Code Examples

Here's some sample code:

```javascript
function fibonacci(n) {
  if (n <= 1) return n;
  return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
}

console.log(fibonacci(10)); // 55
```

## What's Next

In future posts, I'll be sharing:

1. Deep dives into interesting technical problems
2. Project walkthroughs and case studies
3. Insights from my development experience
4. Interactive demonstrations and visualizations

Stay tuned for more content!
