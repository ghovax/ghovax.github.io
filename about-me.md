## Hi, I'm Giovanni Gravili 👋

_R&D-Oriented Computational Physicist_ • _Machine Learning & Full-Stack Developer_

### 🔬 About Me

I hold a Master's degree in Material Physics and Nanoscience, specializing in computational physics. My expertise includes materials modeling, molecular dynamics simulations, and applying machine learning techniques.

I recently finished my Master’s thesis on ML-driven nanoscale tribology simulations using High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems, while also having driven the development as the Technical Lead of an EdTech startup project that won first place in a competitive entrepreneurship program at Dokuz Eylül University (DEU) in Izmir, Türkiye. I enjoy connecting theory and practical application, whether through writing code for physical simulations, building software products, or developing ways to visualize complex data.

With strong programming skills in multiple languages and frameworks, I’m looking for research or industry roles where I can use both computational methods and hands-on development to solve real-world problems in materials science and related areas. I am particularly interested in roles that allow me to apply my expertise in machine learning and computational physics to drive innovation and impact, but I'm always open to new challenges and opportunities independently of the sector and industry.
