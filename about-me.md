## Hi, I'm Giovanni Gravili 👋

**🚀 Primary Role:** MLOps Engineer, Computational Physicist & Full-Stack Developer

**🛠️ Specializations:**

* 🖥️ **HPC Systems:** Performance optimization and low-level engineering.
* 🧠 **Distributed ML:** Scaling models across GPU-accelerated clusters.
* ⚙️ **Systems Engineering:** Designing high-performance, distributed architectures.
* 🏗️ **Full-Stack Infrastructure:** Building robust deployment pipelines.
* 🤖 **Agentic AI:** Developing intelligent systems that can learn and adapt to changing environments.

### 🔬 About Me

I am a **Machine Learning** and **Full-Stack Systems Developer** with a background as a **Computational Physicist** specializing in end-to-end ML pipelines for complex scientific and industrial applications. My expertise is bifurcated between the computational side: engineering low-level **C/C++** and **Rust** engines for **machine learning** and GPU-accelerated simulations, and the architectural side, building the robust full-stack software required to deploy these intelligent systems at scale.

I recently served as the **Technical Lead** for an award-winning EdTech startup project, where I architected multi-stage AI pipelines and led a team through a competitive incubation program. While that role focused on leadership and rapid deployment, my Master’s research in ML-driven nanoscale simulations on **HPC Systems** provided the computational depth necessary for high-stakes modeling; drawing from these two distinct domains allows me to effectively bridge high-level theoretical research with the requirements of production-grade software development.

Utilizing this multi-disciplinary toolkit, leveraging **low-level system languages** to architect the high-performance backends that power advanced **machine learning** models and **agentic AI** frameworks, I am seeking roles where I can build scalable, data-intensive applications. I am particularly interested in engineering, financial, and related challenges that require a deep understanding of **complex systems** to solve real-world problems, and I am always open to new challenges that push the boundaries of current technology.
