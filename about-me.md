# Hi, I'm Giovanni Gravili 👋

### 👨🏽‍💻 Software Engineer

**Systems Development, Machine Learning, Full-Stack Engineering**

I am a Software Engineer with a background in Computational Physics, specializing in high-performance systems from low-level optimization to production cloud deployment. I build compute-intensive backends using C/C++, Rust, and Python, with a focus on numerical methods and algorithm design. As Technical Lead for an AI-powered EdTech platform, I oversaw the full-stack architecture and CI/CD pipelines on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), leading the team to a first-place finish in a premier startup incubation program. I am seeking a Systems or Software Engineering role where I can apply my expertise in high-performance computing and distributed infrastructure to solve complex, large-scale technical challenges.
