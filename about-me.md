# Hi, I'm Giovanni Gravili 👋

### 💡 Machine Learning, Full-Stack & Systems Developer
#### 🔍 *Computational Physics, HPC Systems, End-to-End MLOps*

I am a **Systems Developer and Computational Physicist** specializing in the intersection of High-Performance Computing (HPC), Machine Learning, and full-stack engineering. I architect the entire lifecycle of data-intensive applications: from low-level **C/C++, Rust, and Python** engines optimized for execution speed to the **MLOps pipelines** and **full-stack local and cloud infrastructure** required to deploy intelligent systems at scale.

My background in **Computational Physics** provides the mathematical rigor to solve complex modeling and quantitative challenges with a "performance-first" mindset. I bridge the gap between high-level theoretical research and the pragmatic requirements of production-grade software, ensuring both scientific accuracy and engineering efficiency.

Most recently, I served as **Technical Lead** for an award-winning EdTech startup project, architecting multi-stage AI pipelines and leading a team through a competitive incubation program. This leadership experience is backed by deep computational research in **ML-driven molecular dynamics simulations on HPC systems**. I am now seeking to apply this unique blend of systems engineering and predictive analytics to high-stakes environments in engineering or finance.

### 🛠️ Core Competencies

* 🚀 **HPC & Performance:** Low-level optimization and memory management using **C, C++, and Rust** to achieve maximum computational throughput.
* 🌐 **Full-Stack Engineering:** Architecting scalable, end-to-end web applications and **high-performance APIs** designed to interface with complex, data-heavy backends.
* 🤖 **Applied Machine Learning:** Developing and deploying production-ready models and **agentic AI frameworks** for scientific discovery and industrial automation.
* ⚙️ **MLOps & Infrastructure:** Building robust, automated pipelines for model orchestration, deployment monitoring, and large-scale data lifecycle management.
* 📈 **Quantitative Modeling:** Translating physics-based simulations into modern software solutions for **quantitative risk modeling**, finance, and predictive analytics.

### 🔬 Experience & Research

Recently, I served as the **Technical Lead** for an award-winning EdTech startup project, where I architected multi-stage AI pipelines and led a team through a competitive incubation program. While that role focused on leadership and rapid deployment, my Master’s research in **ML-driven molecular dynamics simulations on HPC systems** provided the computational depth needed for high-stakes engineering. I am currently seeking roles in engineering, finance, or related fields that require a deep understanding of complex systems.
