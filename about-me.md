# Hi, I'm Giovanni Gravili 👋

### 👨🏽‍💻 Full-Stack, Machine Learning & Data Engineer

**Cloud Infrastructure, HPC Systems, Distributed Scientific Computing**

I build full-stack applications, end-to-end data analysis pipelines, and machine learning systems, from training to inference, on cloud infrastructure. Working across the entire stack, I write and architect low-level backend code, including REST APIs, in languages ranging from C/C++ and Rust to Python and Go, and deploy containerized applications with Docker and CI/CD on Google Cloud. My Computational Physics background has taken me from running large-scale ML simulations on Cineca's LEONARDO, one of Europe's top supercomputers, to leading technical development for an EdTech startup, where I owned architecture through deployment and led the team to first place in a competitive incubation program. I pick up new stacks quickly to facilitate onboarding, work well with teams, and deliver tested software that works at scale.
