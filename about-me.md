## Hi, I'm Giovanni Gravili 👋

_R&D-Oriented Computational Physicist_ • _Machine Learning & Full-Stack Developer_

### 🔬 About Me

I am a **Full-Stack Developer** and computational physicist who builds end-to-end **ML Pipelines** and high-performance software for complex scientific and industrial applications. My expertise spans the entire development stack, from architecting low-level Rust engines and GPU-accelerated simulations to deploying agentic AI frameworks and responsive web platforms.

I recently served as the **Technical Lead** for an award-winning EdTech startup project, where I architected multi-stage AI pipelines and led a team through a competitive incubation program. This experience, combined with my Master’s research in ML-driven nanoscale simulations on **HPC Systems**, has shaped my ability to bridge high-level theoretical research with production-grade software development.

With a toolkit ranging from **Low-Level Systems Programming** in C, C++ and Rust to full-stack deployment and **Agentic AI**, I am looking for roles where I can build scalable, data-intensive applications. I am particularly interested in engineering challenges that require a deep understanding of physical systems, machine learning, and robust software architecture to solve real-world problems.
